## About Me

By day I am a customer experience professional with time in a variety of customer facing roles for SaaS companies and non-profit organizations. I've had the opportunity to contribute to traditional customer support teams, as well as in more technical roles working on implementations and enablement. In my free time I have been enjoying continuing my cybersecurity studies and working on a few side projects that I hope to write about here.

I am constantly learning a new tool, software, or skill and I love sharing that knowledge with others. Two areas that interest me are Machine Learning (how can't you be expected with all this progress?) and Cybersecurity. I have embarked on some projects that will give me some hands on experience in ML, specifcally in the area of ops. I've also been studying for the CompTIA CySa+ certification. CySa+ is DoD 8570 IAT Level II2 approved and focuses on the skills needed to be a Cybersecurity Analyst.

When I'm not working or studying you may find me spending time with family, playing an occasional video game, exploring a new city, going for a hike, reading a new book, or rollerblading around my neighborhood.

## About this site

I set out to replace my old site and after some looking I found Hugo. Hugo seemed like an obvious choice for a lightweight personal site. I've used heavier frameworks for my site in the past, but I always felt like it was overkill, even if it was helpful practice. So I chose the best tool for the job: a Static Site Generator like Hugo.

This is a simple static site hosting my personal web page, built using Hugo and hosted on AWS S3. It uses the hugo-blog-awesome theme by hugo-sid along with some styling modifications. It is built and deployed to S3 using GitHub actions, triggered by pushes to the repo. The GitHub Actions and some other notes used are listed below in the mentions.
